# dynamic_ip_aws_sg_updater
Updates the dynamic IP  for SSH access from a Mikrotik router to AWS SG groups.

This script assumes the following:
You have defined the parameters correctly in the beggining of the script.
You have a Mikrotik router. (It doesn`t take a lot of effort to convert this script to universal but i wanted address from my router rather than outside sources)
You have awscli installed, configured with at least a single profile as well as a working ssh user for your Mikrotik router.

Have fun, and if it`s useful please drop me a line.
